      "title": "Rule 0: Mandatory Workflow Pattern (META-RULE - CRITICAL)",
      "content": "**This is the MOST IMPORTANT rule. All other rules are useless if this pattern is not followed.**\n\n### The Problem\n\nThe user has to constantly ask:\n- \"Show which rules apply\"\n- \"Explain your steps\"\n- \"Provide evidence\"\n- \"Use OCR to verify\"\n- \"Why didn't you follow the rules?\"\n- \"Why show screenshot size instead of showing me the screenshot?\"\n\n**This should NOT be necessary.** The assistant should self-enforce this pattern automatically.\n\n### CRITICAL: User Request Analysis (NEW REQUIREMENT)\n\n**BEFORE executing ANY user request, the assistant MUST:**\n\n1. **Break down the request into individual steps**\n2. **For EACH step, identify which rules apply**\n3. **Explain to the user which rules apply to each step**\n4. **Show the planned workflow with rule citations**\n5. **Ask for confirmation if any ambiguity exists**\n\n**Example:**\n\nUser request: \"use selenium and do ocr on the open firefox window with marketplace-bulk-editor in the title to verify\"\n\n**Assistant MUST respond:**\n\n```\n## Analyzing Your Request\n\nYour request breaks down into these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Find the open Firefox window with \"marketplace-bulk-editor\" in title\n**Rules that apply:**\n- Rule 26: Use Existing Browser Window with xdotool - Must find correct Firefox window by title\n- Rule 5: Ask Don't Guess - Must list all windows and find the correct one, not guess\n\n### Step 2: Take screenshot of that window\n**Rules that apply:**\n- Rule 26: Use Existing Browser Window - Must activate window and verify it's in focus\n- Rule 2: Evidence-Before-Assertion - Must show screenshot to user, not just file size\n\n### Step 3: Use OCR to read the screenshot\n**Rules that apply:**\n- Rule 9: OCR Verification - Must show full OCR output, not just summary\n- Rule 2: Evidence-Before-Assertion - Must show actual extracted text\n\n### Step 4: Display screenshot to user\n**Rules that apply:**\n- Rule 2: Evidence-Before-Assertion - User must SEE the screenshot, not just know it exists\n- **CRITICAL**: Must use `code /tmp/screenshot.png` to show screenshot in VSCode file editor\n\n### Step 5: Verify expected content\n**Rules that apply:**\n- Rule 0: Mandatory Workflow Pattern - Must verify compliance with OCR evidence\n- Rule 2: Evidence-Before-Assertion - Must show what was found vs what was expected\n\nProceeding with execution...\n```\n\n**Why This Matters:**\n\n- User shouldn't have to ask \"why show screenshot size instead of showing me the screenshot?\"\n- Assistant should KNOW that showing file size is useless - user needs to SEE the screenshot\n- Rule 2 (Evidence-Before-Assertion) means user must be able to VERIFY the evidence\n- Showing `ls -lh screenshot.png` doesn't let user verify anything\n- Showing screenshot in browser lets user verify visually\n\n### The Mandatory Pattern (PER STEP)\n\n**The pattern must be applied TO EACH STEP, not just once at the beginning.**\n\n#### Phase 1: BEFORE Starting - Plan All Steps\n\n```\n## Rules That Apply to This Task\n\n- Rule X: [Rule name] - [Why it applies to overall task]\n- Rule Y: [Rule name] - [Why it applies to overall task]\n\n## Steps I Will Take\n\nStep 1: [Action description]\nStep 2: [Action description]\nStep 3: [Action description]\n```\n\n#### Phase 2: FOR EACH STEP - Execute with Rule Citations\n\n**FOR EACH STEP, the assistant MUST:**\n\n```\n### Step N: [Step description]\n\n**Rules that apply to THIS step:**\n- Rule X: [Why this rule applies to THIS specific step]\n- Rule Y: [Why this rule applies to THIS specific step]\n\n**Command/Action:**\n[exact command or code to execute]\n\n**Executing:**\n[run the command/action]\n\n**Evidence:**\n[paste FULL terminal output or result]\n\n**Rule compliance verification:**\n- Rule X compliance: ✅ [how THIS step satisfies Rule X]\n- Rule Y compliance: ✅ [how THIS step satisfies Rule Y]\n\n---\n```\n\n**THEN move to next step and repeat the pattern.**\n\n#### Phase 3: AFTER All Steps - Final Verification\n\n```\n## Final Verification\n\nAll steps completed: ✅\nAll rules satisfied: ✅\nEvidence provided for each step: ✅\nOCR verification performed: ✅\n\nTask complete.\n```\n\n### Example of Correct Per-Step Pattern\n\n**User request:** \"Fix the $NaN error\"\n\n**Phase 1: Planning**\n```\n## Rules That Apply to This Task\n\n- Rule 4: Scope Containment - Fix only the $NaN bug\n- Rule 2: Evidence-Before-Assertion - Must show terminal output and OCR proof\n- Rule 26: Use Existing Browser Window - Test in Firefox window 60842863\n\n## Steps I Will Take\n\nStep 1: Find where PRICE is displayed\nStep 2: Fix the NaN handling\nStep 3: Refresh browser and take screenshot\nStep 4: Run OCR to verify fix\nStep 5: Display screenshot to user\n```\n\n**Phase 2: Execution (Per Step)**\n```\n### Step 1: Find where PRICE is displayed\n\n**Rules that apply to THIS step:**\n- Rule 5: Ask Don't Guess - Must investigate before fixing\n\n**Command:**\ngrep -n \"PRICE.*toFixed\" src/components/DataTable.tsx\n\n**Executing:**\n[run command]\n\n**Evidence:**\n887:  <div className=\"font-medium\">${Number(listing.PRICE).toFixed(2)}</div>\n\n**Rule compliance:**\n- Rule 5 compliance: ✅ Found exact location before making changes\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Fix the NaN handling\n\n**Rules that apply to THIS step:**\n- Rule 4: Scope Containment - Change only line 887, nothing else\n\n**Command:**\n[edit DataTable.tsx line 887]\n\n**Executing:**\n[make the edit]\n\n**Evidence:**\nChanged: ${Number(listing.PRICE).toFixed(2)}\nTo: ${Number(listing.PRICE || 0).toFixed(2)}\n\n**Rule compliance:**\n- Rule 4 compliance: ✅ Changed only the specific line, no refactoring\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Refresh browser and take screenshot\n\n**Rules that apply to THIS step:**\n- Rule 26: Use Existing Browser Window - Use Firefox window 60842863\n\n**Command:**\nDISPLAY=:0 xdotool windowactivate 60842863 && xdotool key F5\nDISPLAY=:0 import -window root /tmp/after_fix.png\n\n**Executing:**\n[run commands]\n\n**Evidence:**\n✅ Refreshed Firefox\n✅ Screenshot taken\n\n**Rule compliance:**\n- Rule 26 compliance: ✅ Used existing window 60842863, didn't create new browser\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Run OCR to verify fix\n\n**Rules that apply to THIS step:**\n- Rule 0: Mandatory Workflow Pattern - Must verify with OCR before claiming\n- Rule 2: Evidence-Before-Assertion - Must show full OCR output\n\n**Command:**\npython3 << 'EOF'\nimport pytesseract\nfrom PIL import Image\nimg = Image.open('/tmp/after_fix.png')\ntext = pytesseract.image_to_string(img)\nprint(\"=== FULL OCR OUTPUT ===\")\nprint(text)\nif '$NaN' in text:\n    print(\"❌ BUG STILL EXISTS\")\nelse:\n    print(\"✅ NO NaN ERRORS FOUND\")\nEOF\n\n**Executing:**\n[run OCR]\n\n**Evidence:**\n=== FULL OCR OUTPUT ===\na $0.00\na $0.00\na $0.00\no $0.00\n\n✅ NO NaN ERRORS FOUND\n\n**Rule compliance:**\n- Rule 0 compliance: ✅ Ran OCR before claiming fix worked\n- Rule 2 compliance: ✅ Showed full OCR output as evidence\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Display screenshot to user\n\n**Rules that apply to THIS step:**\n- Rule 2: Evidence-Before-Assertion - User must SEE the screenshot to verify\n- Rule 26: Use Existing Browser Window - Must show screenshot to user\n\n**Why NOT just show file size:**\n- ❌ `ls -lh /tmp/after_fix.png` - Shows file exists but user can't verify content\n- ✅ `code /tmp/after_fix.png` - User can SEE and VERIFY the screenshot in VSCode file editor\n\n**Command:**\ncode /tmp/after_fix.png\n\n**Executing:**\n[open screenshot in VSCode]\n\n**Evidence:**\nOpened /tmp/after_fix.png in VSCode file editor - user can now visually verify the fix\n\n**Rule compliance:**\n- Rule 2 compliance: ✅ User can SEE the screenshot in VSCode, not just know it exists\n- Rule 26 compliance: ✅ Screenshot displayed to user for visual verification\n```\n\n**Phase 3: Final Verification**\n```\n## Final Verification\n\nAll steps completed: ✅\nAll rules satisfied: ✅\nEvidence provided for each step: ✅\nOCR verification performed: ✅\n\nBug fixed: $NaN → $0.00\n```\n\n### Forbidden Patterns\n\n❌ **WRONG - Rules stated once at beginning, not per step:**\n```\n## Rules That Apply\n- Rule 2, Rule 4, Rule 26\n\n[executes all steps without citing which rule applies to each]\n```\n\n❌ **WRONG - No evidence after each step:**\n```\nStep 1: Find PRICE display\nStep 2: Fix it\nStep 3: Test it\n[doesn't show terminal output after each step]\n```\n\n❌ **WRONG - No rule compliance verification per step:**\n```\nStep 1: [action]\nEvidence: [output]\n[doesn't verify which rule was satisfied]\n```\n\n❌ **WRONG - Claims without OCR proof:**\n```\nStep 4: Verify fix\nLooking at the screenshot, I can see it's fixed.\n[didn't run OCR to verify]\n```\n\n❌ **WRONG - Bulk execution without per-step pattern:**\n```\n[runs all 5 steps]\nHere's all the evidence:\n[dumps all output at the end]\n```\n\n### Why This Rule Exists\n\n**User complaint that triggered this rule:**\n> \"explain why I have to ask this\"\n>\n> \"What should happen automatically:\n> - I should state applicable rules BEFORE acting\n> - I should show planned steps BEFORE executing\n> - I should provide evidence AFTER each step\n> - I should verify with OCR BEFORE claiming results\n>\n> This is a meta-rule violation - the rules exist but I'm not following the pattern\"\n\n**Follow-up clarification:**\n> User: \"explain what rules apply as you go through the steps\"\n>\n> Assistant: \"Should I update Rule 0 to enforce the per-step pattern?\"\n>\n> User: \"What is the correct answer?\"\n>\n> Assistant: \"The correct answer is YES. Rule 0 must enforce the pattern PER STEP, not just once at the beginning.\"\n\n**Root cause:**\n- Rules 1-26 exist but assistant doesn't follow the **workflow pattern**\n- Assistant states rules once at the beginning, then executes all steps in bulk\n- Evidence is disconnected from the actions it proves\n- User can't trace which rule justifies which action\n- User has to constantly police compliance\n- This wastes user's time and breaks trust\n\n**Solution:**\n- Rule 0 enforces the **workflow pattern PER STEP**\n- Every step must follow: State Rules (for this step) → Execute → Evidence → Verify Compliance\n- Pattern must be applied to EACH step, not just once at the beginning\n- No exceptions\n\n### Enforcement\n\n**If the assistant:**\n- Takes action without stating applicable rules\n- Executes without showing planned steps\n- Makes claims without providing evidence\n- Claims to see something without OCR verification\n- Skips any part of the mandatory pattern\n\n**Then the user MUST:**\n- Stop the assistant immediately\n- Cite Rule 0 violation\n- Require the assistant to restart with proper pattern\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n✅ User never has to ask \"which rules apply\"\n✅ User never has to ask \"show your steps\"\n✅ User never has to ask \"provide evidence\"\n✅ User never has to ask \"use OCR to verify\"\n✅ User never has to ask \"explain what rules apply as you go through the steps\"\n✅ User can trace each action to its rule justification\n✅ User can verify compliance step-by-step, not just at the end\n✅ User can trust assistant is following rules automatically\n\n**This rule makes all other rules actually work.**\n\n### Key Principle\n\n**The pattern is PER STEP, not per task.**\n\n- ❌ WRONG: State all rules → Execute all steps → Show all evidence\n- ✅ CORRECT: For each step: State rules → Execute → Evidence → Verify compliance\n\n---"

Evidence Before Assertion (HARD STOP)\n\nThe assistant may not claim success of builds, tests, deployments, UI behavior, or APIs without raw evidence.\n\nValid evidence:\n\nFull terminal output\n\ncurl / grep output\n\nBrowser console logs\n\nSelenium logs\n\nScreenshots (when relevant)\n\nRequired format:\n\nEvidence:\n<raw output>\n\nConclusion:\n<derived only from evidence>\n\n3. Execution Boundary (CRITICAL)\n\nThe assistant must never imply it executed actions.\n\nForbidden: “I ran”, “I deployed”, “I tested”, “I verified”.\n\nAllowed:\n\n“The output shows…”\n\n“Based on the provided logs…”\n\n4. Stop-the-Line Conditions (HARD STOP)\n\nImmediately stop if any occur:\n\nConflicting tool outputs\n\nWorkspace ambiguity\n\nUnverified deployment or test claims\n\nExplicit user correction\n\nActive user constraints violated\n\nOnly clarification is allowed until resolved.\n\n5.

Scope Containment\n\n“Fix everything related” means:\n\nFix all instances of the current defect class\n\nDo not add features, refactor, or expand scope unless asked\n\nIf a related issue is found, ask before acting.\n\n7. Observation Layer Integrity\n\nAll statements must be tagged as:\n\nFilesystem\n\nBuild-time\n\nRuntime (browser/API)\n\nDeployment (remote)\n\nCross-layer conclusions without evidence are prohibited.\n\n8. Feature Preservation (CRITICAL)\n\nIf the user says “do not remove features”:\n\nRequired workflow:\n\nEnumerate existing features\n\nMake changes\n\nVerify each feature still works\n\nProvide evidence per feature\n\nNo silent removals. No assumptions.\n\n9. End-to-End Workflow Proof & Selenium Testing (CRITICAL)\n\nLoading a page ≠ proof.\n\nWhen testing or documenting functionality, the assistant must demonstrate the complete user workflow, including:\n\nSetup\n\nUsage\n\nData persistence\n\nIntegration points\n\nFailure paths (where applicable)\n\n### Selenium Testing Requirements (MANDATORY)\n\n**CRITICAL: Selenium tests MUST run in VISIBLE mode (NOT headless) unless explicitly specified otherwise by the user.**\n\nForbidden:\n- `options.add_argument('--headless')`\n- `options.headless = True`\n- Any headless configuration\n\nAllowed only if user explicitly requests:\n- \"run selenium in headless mode\"\n- \"use headless browser\"\n\nRationale: Visible mode allows user to see what's happening, verify behavior visually, and debug issues. Headless mode hides problems and prevents user observation.\n\n### Screenshot Requirements (MANDATORY)\n\n**All screenshots MUST:**\n1. **Be taken at EACH major step** of the workflow (not just initial page load)\n2. **Be saved with descriptive filenames** (e.g., `screenshot_01_frontend_loaded.png`, `screenshot_02_backend_status.png`)\n3. **Be verified with OCR** (Tesseract or similar) to confirm text is visible\n4. **Be embedded in documentation** (README.md, evidence documents) with:\n   - Image markdown: `![Description](./screenshot_name.png)`\n   - Caption describing what the screenshot shows\n   - OCR verification note if applicable\n5. **Show actual UI state** (not blank pages, loading screens, or error states unless testing errors)\n6. **Include console logs** captured via Chrome DevTools Protocol\n7. **Be taken in VISIBLE mode** (user can see browser window during test)\n\n### MANDATORY: Test Script with Evidence (HARD STOP)\n\n**Before claiming any feature is complete, the assistant MUST**:\n\n- [ ] Create test script (`test_*.py`) that runs in VISIBLE mode\n- [ ] Take screenshots at EVERY step (minimum 10 for complete workflow)\n- [ ] Use OCR to verify EVERY screenshot\n- [ ] **Display OCR output in terminal** (proof it was read)\n- [ ] Test COMPLETE workflow (not just page load)\n- [ ] Capture browser console logs\n- [ ] Show console log summary (total, errors, warnings)\n- [ ] Embed screenshots in README.md or evidence document\n- [ ] **Show terminal output proving all above steps were done**\n\n**If ANY item is unchecked, the feature is NOT complete.**\n\n**Example terminal output REQUIRED**:\n```\nSTEP 1: Load page and verify UI\n📸 Screenshot saved: screenshots/01_page_loaded.png\n   File size: 1,234,567 bytes\n\n🔍 OCR Verification:\n   Extracted text (first 500 chars):\n   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   Marketplace Bulk Editor\n   Upload Excel File\n   Backend Status: Connected\n   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n✅ Verification for Step 1:\n   ✅ Found: 'Marketplace Bulk Editor'\n   ✅ Found: 'Upload'\n   ✅ Found: 'Backend'\n\n📋 Browser Console Logs (Step 1):\n   Total entries: 5\n   Errors: 0\n   Warnings: 0\n```\n\n**This terminal output is PROOF that**:\n- Screenshot was actually taken (not just claimed)\n- OCR was actually run (not just claimed)\n- Text was actually verified (not just claimed)\n- Console logs were actually captured (not just claimed)\n- Feature actually works (not just claimed)\n\n**Without this evidence, claims of \"it works\" are not credible.**\n\n**Why this matters**: See `WHY_SCREENSHOTS_MATTER.md` for full explanation of why the user repeatedly asks for screenshots and OCR verification.\n\n### Complete Workflow Testing (Rule 22)\n\n**The assistant MUST test the COMPLETE workflow, not just initial page load.**\n\n**For backend/database features, minimum steps:**\n1. Setup: `./docker-start.sh` + container status\n2. User registration: API call + JWT tokens\n3. Login: API call + response\n4. Create listing: API call + database verification\n5. Templates: Creation + usage\n6. OCR: File upload + processing + results\n7. Export: Export + file content verification\n8. Rate limiting: 429 error after exceeding limits\n9. Database: `psql` queries proving persistence\n10. Redis: `redis-cli` commands proving caching\n11. Cleanup: `./docker-stop.sh` + data preservation\n\n**For UI features, minimum steps:**\n1. Initial load\n2. Backend status (collapsed + expanded)\n3. File upload area\n4. Data table with data\n5. Cell editing (before/after)\n6. Export preview modal\n7. Dark mode toggle\n8. Search/filter\n9. Bulk actions\n10. Undo/redo\n\n**Minimum screenshots required:**\n- Backend/database features: 13+ screenshots\n- UI features: 10+ screenshots\n\n### Console Log Capture (MANDATORY)\n\n**All Selenium tests MUST capture console logs:**\n\n```python\nfrom selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options\n\noptions = Options()\noptions.set_capability('goog:loggingPrefs', {'browser': 'ALL'})\n# DO NOT add --headless unless user explicitly requests it\n\ndriver = webdriver.Chrome(options=options)\ndriver.get(\"http://localhost:5173\")\n\n# Capture console logs\nfor entry in driver.get_log('browser'):\n    print(f\"[{entry['level']}] {entry['message']}\")\n```\n\n**Report:**\n- Total console entries\n- Number of errors (should be 0 for successful tests)\n- Number of warnings\n- Sample of info/debug messages\n\n### OCR Verification (MANDATORY)\n\n**All screenshots MUST be verified with OCR:**\n\n```python\nimport pytesseract\nfrom PIL import Image\n\nimg = Image.open('screenshot_01_frontend_loaded.png')\ntext = pytesseract.image_to_string(img)\n\n# Verify expected text appears\nassert \"Docker Backend Connected\" in text\nassert \"Marketplace Bulk Editor\" in text\n```\n\n**Report:**\n- Screenshot filename\n- File size\n- OCR extracted text (key phrases)\n- Verification status (✅ or ❌)\n\n### Documentation Requirements (MANDATORY)\n\n**After Selenium testing, the assistant MUST:**\n\n1. **Embed screenshots in README.md** with:\n   - Section titled \"📸 Screenshots (Selenium Testing - VISIBLE Mode)\"\n   - Each screenshot with descriptive caption\n   - OCR verification note\n   - Console logs status (0 errors)\n   - Test date\n\n2. **Create evidence document** (e.g., COMPLETE_WORKFLOW_EVIDENCE.md) with:\n   - Executive summary of all tested features\n   - Step-by-step workflow with terminal output\n   - API request/response examples\n   - Database query results\n   - Screenshot references with OCR results\n   - Compliance checklist\n\n3. **Update backend/README.md** (if applicable) with:\n   - Complete API workflow examples\n   - Database verification examples\n   - Redis verification examples\n   - Rate limiting demonstration\n\n### Failure to Comply\n\n**If the assistant:**\n- Uses headless mode without explicit user request\n- Takes only 1-2 screenshots instead of complete workflow\n- Does not verify screenshots with OCR\n- Does not embed screenshots in README.md\n- Does not capture console logs\n- Does not test complete workflow\n\n**Then the user MUST stop the assistant and request compliance with Rule 9.**\n\n10. User Constraints Override Everything\n\nExplicit user constraints override:\n\nDefaults\n\nPrior behavior\n\n“Best practices”\n\nConstraints persist until revoked.\n\nRequired acknowledgment:\n\nActive constraints:\n1. …\n2. …\n\nKnown Critical Failure Classes (Do Not Regress)\n\nThese are non-negotiable checks when applicable:\n\nORM Safety\n\nNever use reserved names (metadata, query, session, registry)\n\nTest DB initialization immediately\n\nDocker Configuration\n\nAll required env vars must be passed (DB, cache, rate limits, secrets)\n\nVerify connectivity before claiming success\n\nPython Versions\n\nUse stable Python (3.11 / 3.12) in Docker\n\nDo not use bleeding-edge images\n\nDatabase Alignment\n\nDo not change database type without user approval\n\nPreserve SQL export paths if present\n\nTone After Errors\n\nAfter corrections or failures:\n\nNeutral\n\nTechnical\n\nFactual\n\nNo celebratory language."

      "content": "**When the user says:**\n- \"the page is open in firefox\"\n- \"page is open in firefox, do not waste time using chrome\"\n- \"Import more fails\" (implies they already tried it)\n- \"the button doesn't work\" (implies they already clicked it)\n- Any statement indicating they have the app already open\n\n**The assistant MUST:**\n1. **Find the CORRECT Firefox window** (see workflow below)\n2. **Activate that specific window** using its window ID\n3. **Use source code to determine button location** (don't guess)\n4. **Use OCR to find exact coordinates** of UI elements\n5. **Click buttons using xdotool** to trigger actions\n6. **Read errors from Debug Console** (already visible in UI per Rule 25)\n\n**The assistant MUST NOT:**\n- Create new Selenium WebDriver instances\n- Write new test scripts that start from scratch\n- Ask user to manually click buttons\n- Ask user to copy/paste console output (Debug Console already shows it)\n- Ignore that the user has already set up the browser state\n- Use `xdotool search --name \"Firefox\" windowactivate` without finding the CORRECT window first\n\n**Why This Rule Exists:**\n- User has already spent time setting up browser state (login, data upload, etc.)\n- Creating new browser instances wastes user's time\n- User explicitly stated which browser they're using\n- Debug Console already shows all errors (Rule 25)\n- Source code tells us exactly where buttons are located\n- OCR can find exact pixel coordinates\n- **Multiple Firefox windows may be open - must find the RIGHT one**\n\n**MANDATORY WORKFLOW - Find Correct Firefox Window:**\n\n```bash\n# Step 1: List ALL Firefox windows with their titles\nDISPLAY=:0 xdotool search --name \"Firefox\" 2>&1 | while read wid; do\n  echo \"Window $wid: $(DISPLAY=:0 xdotool getwindowname $wid 2>&1)\"\ndone\n\n# Output example:\n# Window 60817409: Firefox\n# Window 60838438: Firefox\n# Window 60842863: marketplace-bulk-editor — Mozilla Firefox Private Browsing\n\n# Step 2: Find the window ID that contains \"marketplace\" or the app name\n# In this example: 60842863\n\n# Step 3: Activate THAT SPECIFIC window\nDISPLAY=:0 xdotool windowactivate 60842863\n\n# Step 4: Wait for window to come into focus\nsleep 1\n\n# Step 5: Verify window is active by taking screenshot\nDISPLAY=:0 import -window root /tmp/firefox_active.png\n\n# Step 6: Use OCR to verify correct window is showing\npython3 << 'EOF'\nimport pytesseract\nfrom PIL import Image\nimg = Image.open('/tmp/firefox_active.png')\ntext = pytesseract.image_to_string(img)\nif 'Marketplace Bulk Editor' in text:\n    print(\"✅ Correct Firefox window is active\")\nelse:\n    print(\"❌ Wrong window - marketplace app not visible\")\n    print(text[:500])\nEOF\n```\n\n**MANDATORY WORKFLOW - Click Button in Active Window:**\n\n```bash\n# Step 1: Firefox window is already active (from above)\n\n# Step 2: Use OCR to find button coordinates\npython3 << 'EOF'\nimport pytesseract\nfrom PIL import Image\nimg = Image.open('/tmp/firefox_active.png')\ndata = pytesseract.image_to_data(img, output_type=pytesseract.Output.DICT)\nfor i, text in enumerate(data['text']):\n    if 'Import More' in text or 'Import' in text:\n        x = data['left'][i] + data['width'][i]//2\n        y = data['top'][i] + data['height'][i]//2\n        print(f\"Found '{text}' at ({x}, {y})\")\nEOF\n\n# Step 3: Click the button at those coordinates\nDISPLAY=:0 xdotool mousemove <x> <y> click 1\n\n# Step 4: Wait for action to complete\nsleep 2\n\n# Step 5: Take screenshot of result\nDISPLAY=:0 import -window root /tmp/after_click.png\n\n# Step 6: Use OCR to read Debug Console for errors\npython3 << 'EOF'\nimport pytesseract\nfrom PIL import Image\nimg = Image.open('/tmp/after_click.png')\ntext = pytesseract.image_to_string(img)\nprint(\"=== SCREEN AFTER CLICK ===\")\nprint(text)\nEOF\n```\n\n**How to Find Button Location from Source Code:**\n\n1. Search codebase for button text (e.g., \"Import More\")\n2. Find the component that renders it\n3. Understand the layout structure\n4. Use OCR to locate it on screen\n5. Click using xdotool\n\n**Example:**\n```typescript\n// Source code shows:\n<button className=\"...\">\n  <Upload size={16} />\n  Import More\n</button>\n\n// This tells us:\n// - Button contains text \"Import More\"\n// - Button has Upload icon\n// - Use OCR to find \"Import More\" text\n// - Click at those coordinates\n```\n\n**Common Mistakes (FORBIDDEN):**\n\n❌ **WRONG - Activates random Firefox window:**\n```bash\nDISPLAY=:0 xdotool search --name \"Firefox\" windowactivate\n# This activates the FIRST window found, not the correct one!\n```\n\n❌ **WRONG - Doesn't verify which window is active:**\n```bash\nDISPLAY=:0 xdotool windowactivate 12345\n# Takes screenshot but doesn't check if marketplace app is visible\n```\n\n❌ **WRONG - Takes screenshot but window isn't in focus:**\n```bash\nDISPLAY=:0 import -window root /tmp/screenshot.png\n# Screenshot shows IDE/terminal instead of Firefox\n# User complains: \"I am not seeing the target Firefox window come into focus\"\n```\n\n✅ **CORRECT - Find specific window, activate it, verify it:**\n```bash\n# 1. List all windows\nDISPLAY=:0 xdotool search --name \"Firefox\" | while read wid; do\n  echo \"$wid: $(DISPLAY=:0 xdotool getwindowname $wid)\"\ndone\n\n# 2. Find the one with \"marketplace\" in title\n# Output: 60842863: marketplace-bulk-editor — Mozilla Firefox\n\n# 3. Activate THAT window\nDISPLAY=:0 xdotool windowactivate 60842863\n\n# 4. Wait and verify\nsleep 1\nDISPLAY=:0 import -window root /tmp/verify.png\npython3 -c \"import pytesseract; from PIL import Image; print('Marketplace' in pytesseract.image_to_string(Image.open('/tmp/verify.png')))\"\n# Output: True (verified!)\n```\n\n**What's Missing from Previous Rules:**\n\n**Rule 23** said \"use existing browser\" but was marked DEPRECATED and didn't explain HOW to use xdotool effectively.\n\n**The gap was:**\n- ❌ No instruction to LIST all Firefox windows first\n- ❌ No instruction to FIND the correct window by title\n- ❌ No instruction to ACTIVATE the specific window ID\n- ❌ No instruction to VERIFY the window is in focus\n- ❌ No instruction to use source code to find button locations\n- ❌ No instruction to use OCR for exact coordinates\n- ❌ No instruction to click buttons with xdotool\n- ❌ No instruction to read Debug Console for errors (instead of asking user)\n\n**This rule fills that gap by requiring:**\n1. ✅ List ALL Firefox windows with titles\n2. ✅ Find the window ID containing the app name\n3. ✅ Activate THAT SPECIFIC window by ID\n4. ✅ Verify window is in focus with OCR\n5. ✅ Use source code to understand UI structure\n6. ✅ Use OCR to find exact pixel coordinates\n7. ✅ Use xdotool to click buttons\n8. ✅ Read Debug Console automatically (don't ask user)\n9. ✅ Take screenshots before/after to verify actions\n\n**Failure to Comply:**\n\nIf the assistant:\n- Uses `xdotool search --name \"Firefox\" windowactivate` without finding correct window first\n- Doesn't list all Firefox windows to find the right one\n- Doesn't verify the window is in focus before clicking\n- Takes screenshots that show IDE/terminal instead of Firefox\n- Creates new Selenium instance when user said \"page is open\"\n- Asks user to click buttons manually\n- Asks user to copy/paste console output\n- Ignores user's browser choice (Firefox vs Chrome)\n- Doesn't use source code to find button locations\n\n**Then the user MUST stop the assistant and cite Rule 26.**\n\n**User Complaint That Triggered This Rule:**\n> \"again I am not seeing the target Firefox window come into focus - why?\"\n\n**Root Cause:**\n- Assistant used `xdotool search --name \"Firefox\" windowactivate` which activates the FIRST window found\n- Multiple Firefox windows were open (7 windows)\n- The correct window (ID 60842863 with \"marketplace-bulk-editor\" in title) was NOT the first one\n- Screenshots showed IDE/terminal instead of Firefox\n- Assistant didn't verify which window was active\n\n**Solution:**\n- ALWAYS list all windows first\n- ALWAYS find the correct window by title\n- ALWAYS activate by specific window ID\n- ALWAYS verify with OCR that correct window is showing\n\n---"
