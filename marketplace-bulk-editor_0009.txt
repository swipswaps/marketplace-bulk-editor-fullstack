✏️ Inline editing: Click any cell to edit directly
🔄 Combine spreadsheets: Merge multiple files into one unified list
💾 Smart export: Download Facebook-compatible Excel format
📱 Mobile responsive: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
🌙 Dark mode: Full dark/light theme support
⌨️ Keyboard navigation: Arrow keys, shortcuts (Ctrl+Z/Y for undo/redo)
✅ Validation: Real-time warnings for missing/invalid data
Tech Stack:

React 19 + TypeScript + Vite 7
Tailwind CSS for styling
SheetJS for Excel handling
Deployed on GitHub Pages
Live Demo: https://swipswaps.github.io/marketplace-bulk-editor/

The app runs entirely client-side (no backend) and supports the official Facebook Marketplace format with columns like TITLE, PRICE, CONDITION, DESCRIPTION, CATEGORY, and OFFER SHIPPING.

Here are some questions you can ask Augment:

02:01 PM
review chat logs at @marketplace-bulk-editor0008.txt and @marketplace-bulk-editor0007.txt and explain what the user is asking, expecting and needs next

I'll review both chat log files to understand the user's requests and expectations.

Let me search for these files in the workspace:

Found them! They're in the notes directory. Let me read both files:

Based on my review of both chat logs, here's what the user is asking for, expecting, and needs next:

What the User Asked For:
The user had OCR results from scanning product catalogs (solar panels and equipment) and wanted to convert them into Facebook Marketplace Bulk Upload format. They worked with ChatGPT to:

Process OCR data from ocr_results.xlsx and ocr_results_2.xlsx
Convert to Facebook-compatible format using the official Facebook_Marketplace_Bulk_Upload.xlsx template
Generate upload-ready files that could be directly uploaded to Facebook Marketplace
What the User Got:
ChatGPT created Python scripts that:

Parsed OCR text (tab-delimited product listings)
Mapped data to Facebook's required columns (TITLE, DESCRIPTION, CATEGORY, OFFER SHIPPING)
Generated files: Facebook_Marketplace_Bulk_Upload_FILLED.xlsx and Facebook_Marketplace_Bulk_Upload_FILLED_2.xlsx
Left PRICE and CONDITION blank (not in OCR data)
Set CATEGORY to "Electronics" and OFFER SHIPPING to "No"
The user then manually edited these files (creating _edited.xlsx versions) and copied them to the catalog directory.

What the User Expects:
The user has now started the Marketplace Bulk Editor web app (running on localhost:5173) and appears to want to:

Use the web interface instead of Python scripts to process OCR data
Load and edit the generated Facebook Marketplace files in a visual, user-friendly way
Combine multiple spreadsheets (they have multiple OCR result files)
Fill in missing data (prices, conditions) through the web UI
Export clean, validated files ready for Facebook upload
What the User Needs Next:
Load the existing catalog files into the Marketplace Bulk Editor web app
Test the upload/edit/export workflow with their real data
Potentially enhance the app to:
Better handle OCR-imported data (clean up artifacts like single letters "A" or numbers "7")
Add batch editing features for PRICE and CONDITION
Validate against Facebook's requirements (50-item limit, required fields)
Support merging multiple OCR result files
Add filtering/deduplication features
Workflow integration: The user likely wants to streamline the process:
OCR → Clean data → Load into web app → Edit → Export → Upload to Facebook
The user is transitioning from command-line Python scripts to using the visual web-based Marketplace Bulk Editor for a more efficient, repeatable workflow for managing their solar equipment catalog on Facebook Marketplace.
